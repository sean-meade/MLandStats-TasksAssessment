    "The square root of a real number $ S $, usually denoted as $ \\sqrt{S} $, is a non-negative number that when multiplied by itself will give you $ S $. Algebraically, this means a procedure for finding the non-negative root of the equation $ f(x) = x^{2} - S $ when $ f(x) = 0 $ (i.e. $ x^{2} - S = 0 $). So starting off if we subtract $ S $ from both sides [1] we're given:\n",

Due to the fact that it's an irrational number only an approximation of the square root can be calulated. It is important to note that even with a perfect square (for example $ 2 = \\sqrt{4} $) the different methods for calulating the square root may only return an approximation [1]."

    "#### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to calculate the square root of a number (or at least the approximation). In this exercise we will use Newton's method, the most suited for programmatic calculation[1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Newtons method is actually a procedure used for solving equations of the form $ f(x) = 0 $. Which is perfect for us because we want to find x when $ f(x) = 0 $ where in our instance $ f(x) = x^{2} - S $.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works as follows: \n",
    "First we need a guess of the square root of the real number in question. In math talk it means we need a guess of $ x $ to start with. Preferably it should be as close to $ S $ as we can determine. We call this guess $ x_{n} $ and we use this along with Newton's method to find a closer approximation of the square root of $ S $, $ x_{ n + 1 } $ [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say our $ S $ is 100. We know that the square root, $ x $, is 10, but what if we didn't? Say we guessed the square root as 33. This 33 is now our $ x_{ n } $. If we were to plot this in terms $ x $ vs. $ S $ our $ x $ and $ y $ coordinates would be (33, 33<sup>2</sup>). Which is (33, 1,089). This clearly is the wrong answer but our concern is with getting a more accurate guess of $ x $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can show (using matplotlib) the equation of the line $ S = x^{ 2 } $ where $ 0 < x \\leq \\frac{S * 4}{10} $ (shown as the blue line below) along with where our guess is on this line (the red dot) [3].\n",

    "We can see from the above graph that our guess was way off. The x-axis represents the number we want to square ($ x $) and the y-axis represents the square of that number ($ S $). From the graph we can see that the square of our guess 33 is close to 1,000 (it's actually 1,089). This is where Newton's method comes into its own. The green line extends out from where the 100 mark is. Where the green line intercepts the blue curve is where our square root lies. You'll see if you change the value of our guess (in math terms $ x_{ n } $ and in our code above `x_n`) our red indecator will get closer or further from this intercept the closer or further you get from the correct guess of 10 [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exacly what Newton's method does. It starts with a guess and using the method, that we will look at below, gets closer and closer to this intercept (but never actually touches it, hence the approximation of the square root).\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we find the next (hopefully closer) approximation? Newton's method uses this starting point, $ x_{ n } $ (where $ x_{ n } > 0 $), and gets the tangent line (the red line above) to the function $ f(x) = x^{ 2 } - S ($ when $ f(x) = 0 $) and where this line cuts the x-axis is where is our new approximation $ x_{ n + 1 } $ is[4]. Using this new approximation we can see that we are closer from our first guess but still too far to consider accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of this tangent line is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = f(x_n) + f'(x_n)(x - x_n) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f'(x) = 2x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing the next iteration means that $ x_n = x $ and $ n_{ n + 1 } = x_n $. We're looking for $ n_{ n + 1 } $ for where this line crosses the x-axis, meaning $ y = 0 $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 0 = f(x_{ n + 1 }) + f'(x_{ n + 1 })(x_n - x_{ n + 1 }) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearanging we can represent $ x_{ n + 1 } $ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{ n + 1 } = x_n - \\frac{ f(x_n) }{ f'(x_n) } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So by filling in what we know for the square root the equation then becomes:\n",

A real number is a positive number that can be represented on a line. For this it needs to be positive and quantifiable. We know our initial guess of $ x_n $ is positive and real. There are three conditions for our $ x_n $. The frist is that $ x_{ n }^2 > S $ meaning our initial guess was higher then $ x $. The second is that it is lower then our guess, $ x_{ n }^2 < S $. Finally that our guess is exactly right, $ x_{ n }^2 = S $ (i.e. that $ x_n = x $). We'll do this by trying to calculate the difference between one iteration and the previous ($ x_{ n + 1 } - x_n $). We do this by subtracting both sides of the previous equation by $ x_n $ [4]:\n",

    "$$ x_{ n + 1 } - x_n = \\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \\left( x_n + \\frac{ S }{ x_n }\\right) - x_n $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ x_{ n + 1 } - x_n = \\frac{ 1 }{ 2x_n } \\left( S - x_{ n }^2 \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So for $ x_{ n }^2 > S $ we know that $ S - x_{ n }^2 $ is negative and approaching zero. In turn this means that $ x_{ n + 1 } - x_n $ (the error in our approximation between $ x_n $ and $ x_{ n + 1 } $) is negative and approaching zero. This tells us that each iteration is less then the one before and we know that it is approaching $ x $. Our initial guess, $ x_0 $ and the square root we're trying to calculate ($ x $) are both positive. From this we can infer that $ x_n \\leq x_{ n + 1 } \\leq x_{ n + 2 } \\leq ... x $ meaning that $ x_n $ does infact stay positive as it approaches $ x $. The same can be infered from $ x_{ n }^2 < S $. Where $ x_n \\geq x_{ n + 1 } \\geq x_{ n + 2 } \\geq ... x $. \n",

    "### Full solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is however a way to produce the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. The problem with this is you have to return it as a string. The solution lies in multiply by powers of ten. This idea is best explained with the square root of 4 and the square root of 40,000 [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "So we know that the square root of 4 is 2 ($ \\sqrt{4} = 2 $). If we run a little algebra we can use the square root of 4 to solve for the square root of 40,000:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{40000} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10000} = \\sqrt{4} \\times \\sqrt{10000} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{40000} = 2 \\times \\sqrt{10000} = 2 \\times 100 = 200 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This only works for multiples of 100 however the same cannot be said for the 10s. \n",

    "The same can be done for the square root of 2. Except this time we want 100 decimal places. This means in order to get our answer to 100 decimal our S must be to the order of $ 100^{100} $. This will give us an integer answer that is 100 digits long and is 100 decimal places from the square root of 2.\n",
