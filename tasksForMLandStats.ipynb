    "\n",
    "The square root of a real number $ S $, usually denoted as $ \\sqrt{S} $, is a non-negative number that when multiplied by itself will give you $ S $. Algebraically, this means a procedure for finding the non-negative root of the equation $ f(x) = x^{2} - S $ when $ f(x) = 0 $ (i.e. $ x^{2} - S = 0 $). When we subtract both sides by $ S $ [1] we're given:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x^{2} = S $$\n",
    "\n",
    "because a sqaured number can't be negative. Then by taking the square root of both sides (which is equivalent to putting something to the power of a half, $ x^{ \\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } } $) we are left with the square root of $ S $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = \\sqrt{S} \\;\\; or \\;\\; x = S^{ \\frac{ 1 }{ 2 } } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the representation of the square root ($ x $) of a number ($ S $). Where, like we said above, when $ x $ is squared (or multiplied by itself) it produces $ S $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every real number has two square roots. The square root we're interested in is the principal irrational number (not expressible as a ratio of two integers). Due to the fact that it's an irrational number only an approximation of the square root can be calulated. It is important to note that even with a perfect square (for example $ 2 = \\sqrt{4} $) the different methods for calulating the square root may only return an approximation [1]."

    "My function below named `sqrt2()` is a function that determines the square root of a number (the variable named `inputNum`). The task is to determine the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Although I think the function is capable of this the task has stipulated that no modules can be imported to complete the task I haven't been able to find a way to save a floating number larger then 15 decimal places. It is currently up to 16 decimal places of accuracy.\n",

    "From here we have to determine the numbers after the decimal point. We do this in a similar way but it is a little more tricky due to decimal fractions. Unfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions [4]. Because of this I have had to reuse the same two lines of code to remove the tail end of the approximation to reduce inaccuracy. The code is structured as follows. It takes the inaccurate number (we'll call this `approx`)  "
