# MLandStats-TasksAssessment

This is my submission for Machine Learning and Statistics module with GMIT due by the 18th of December. Four tasks given periodically over the semester to be completed in the same Jupyter notebook.

Task 1: In this task I explain how Newtons method works and how it's used to produce the square root of a number. I build a function to calculate the square root of two and why the limitations of computing make it difficult to get an accuracy greater then 15 decimal places. Lastly I create a function that can produce the square root of 2 as a string.
